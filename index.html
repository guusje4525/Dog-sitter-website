    <!-- DISCLAIMER
   
      As stated in the assignment, I shouldn't spend more then 2 hours on all the objectives.
      This is my result from working on it in a limited time, being primairly a backend developer and not so much frontend
   
      This is only the desktop page and hasn't been made responsive.
